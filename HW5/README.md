HW5 Source Code 
In order to run the three source code files, place the Input Files in the same location as the source code files. 
Running the source code files requires the following commandline arguments to be passed:

1) hashfile.cpp -> Takes a filename as a commandline argument.
   Example: hashfile.cpp filename.txt

2) diff.cpp -> Takes two filenames as commandline arguments.
   Example: diff.cpp file1.txt file2.txt
   
3) diffprint.cpp -> Takes two filenames as commandline arguments.
   Examples: diffprint.cpp file1.txt file2.txt
   
Each of these files when run with the correct arguments generates the desired output printed to the console.
